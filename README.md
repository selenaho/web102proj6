## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Preventing main page from taking time to reload when navigating from detailed page back to main page (used useOutletContext with Layout.jsx passing the data down to App.jsx rather than App.jsx remaking all the API calls to repopulate the data)
